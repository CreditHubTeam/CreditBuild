## 🚧 **APIs Not Accessible in Production Build**

These endpoints exist in code but return 404/405 because they're not registered in production build:

### ⚠️ POST /api/education/complete
**Status:** 405 Method Not Allowed  
**Expected Payload:**
```json
{
  "walletAddress": "0x...",
  "educationId": 1
}
```

### ⚠️ GET /api/challenges/daily
**Status:** 404 Not Found  
**Expected:** Daily challenges for specific user

### ⚠️ POST /api/claims
**Status:** 404 Not Found  
**Expected Payload:**
```json
{
  "userAddress": "0x...",
  "challengeId": 1,
  "proof": {}
}
```

### ⚠️ GET /api/achievements  
**Status:** 404 Not Found  
**Expected:** List all achievements

### ⚠️ GET /api/users/{address}/achievements
**Status:** 404 Not Found  
**Expected:** User's unlocked achievements

## 📊 **Database Status**

Successfully populated with:
- ✅ **3 Users** registered
- ✅ **10 Challenges** across multiple categories
- ✅ **3 Achievements** with JSON conditions:
  - First Steps (minChallenges: 1) → 50 points
  - Week Warrior (minChallenges: 7) → 200 points
  - Credit Champion (minCreditScore: 800) → 1000 points
- ✅ **1 UserChallenge** completion tracked
- ✅ **3 Education** items seeded

---

## 🎯 **Daily Challenge System Flow (Designed)**

Based on code review, here's how the system should work:

### Flow 1: Daily Challenges
1. **GET /api/challenges/daily?address={wallet}** → Returns 4 random challenges for today
2. User selects and completes challenge
3. **POST /api/claims** → Submit challenge completion
4. Backend updates:
   - User stats (totalChallenges, points, creditScore)
   - Streak tracking (if first challenge of the day)
   - Checks achievement conditions
   - Awards new achievements if conditions met

### Flow 2: Achievements
1. On challenge completion, `AchievementsService.checkAndAward(userId)` runs
2. System checks all achievement conditions:
   - `minChallenges`: Total challenges completed
   - `minStreak`: Consecutive days with at least 1 challenge
   - `minCreditScore`: Credit score threshold
   - `challengeCategory`: Specific category completion
3. New achievements automatically created in `UserAchievement` table
4. **GET /api/users/{address}/achievements** → Shows unlocked achievements

### Flow 3: Education
1. **GET /api/education** → User browses educational content
2. User clicks to read content (FE shows popup)
3. User confirms completion in popup
4. **POST /api/education/complete** → Marks education as completed
5. Backend creates `UserEducation` record

### Flow 4: Streak System
- Streak increases ONLY if user completes at least 1 challenge per day
- Resets to 0 if user misses a day
- Tracked via `streakDays` field on User model
- Used as condition for streak-based achievements

## 🔧 **Required Actions to Enable Full Testing**

1. **Rebuild Docker with Dev Mode:**
   ```bash
   # Modify Dockerfile CMD to use: npm run dev
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose build
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Alternative: Run locally without Docker**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Then retest all endpoints**
